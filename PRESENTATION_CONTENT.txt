SLIDE 3 — PROBLEM STATEMENT
================================================================

Problem Statement

• Students often struggle to understand complex concepts while
  studying alone, leading to frustration and poor retention.

• Searching online returns lengthy, irrelevant, or overly
  technical results that are hard to digest.

• Teachers and tutors are not always available for instant
  help — especially during late-night study sessions or
  exam preparation.

• Traditional study methods like re-reading notes are passive
  and ineffective for deep learning.

• There is no single tool that can explain topics simply,
  summarize long notes, AND generate quizzes/flashcards
  on demand.

• Students need an intelligent, always-available companion
  that adapts to their learning level and provides active
  recall-based study tools.


================================================================
SLIDE 4 — PROPOSED SOLUTION
================================================================

Proposed Solution

AI-Powered Study Buddy — A web-based intelligent study
companion that helps students learn effectively using AI.

Key Features:
  💬 AI Chat Assistant
     → Conversational interface to ask questions naturally

  💡 Topic Explainer
     → Explains any concept at 3 levels: Simple,
       Intermediate, and Advanced

  📝 Note Summarizer
     → Condenses long study notes into concise bullet
       points with key term extraction

  ❓ Quiz Generator
     → Creates multiple-choice quizzes with instant
       feedback and explanations

  🃏 Flashcard Creator
     → Generates interactive flip-cards for active
       recall and spaced repetition

  🔥 Gamification
     → Study streak tracking to keep students motivated

└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Technology Used:
  Frontend  →  HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
  Backend   →  Node.js, Express.js
  Design    →  CSS Grid, Flexbox, CSS Animations
  Icons     →  Font Awesome 6.5
  Fonts     →  Google Fonts (Inter, JetBrains Mono)


================================================================
SLIDE 6 — ALGORITHM & DEPLOYMENT
================================================================

Algorithm & Deployment

Core Algorithms:

  1. Text Summarization Algorithm
     • Splits input into sentences
     • Removes stop words (200+ common words)
     • Calculates word frequency scores
     • Extracts top-ranked sentences as summary
     • Computes compression ratio

  2. Quiz Generation Algorithm
     • Maps topic to question templates
     • Generates 4 options per question (1 correct)
     • Randomizes question selection
     • Provides detailed explanations per answer

  3. Flashcard Generation Algorithm
     • Creates question-answer pairs from topic
     • Supports Markdown formatting in answers
     • Tracks card status: Unseen → Review → Mastered
     • Implements spaced repetition logic

  4. Chat Response Engine
     • Keyword-based intent detection
     • Context-aware reply generation
     • Suggests follow-up actions

Deployment:
  • Platform    →  GitHub (Source Code Repository)
  • Runtime     →  Node.js (localhost:3000)
  • Repository  →  github.com/Oishi-Das/AI-powered-study-buddy
  • Command     →  npm install → node server.js

SLIDE 8 — CONCLUSION
================================================================

Conclusion

• The AI-Powered Study Buddy successfully addresses the problem
  of students struggling to study complex topics independently.

• It combines five powerful tools — Chat, Explainer, Summarizer,
  Quiz, and Flashcards — into one unified, easy-to-use platform.

• The application promotes active recall and self-testing, which
  are proven to be the most effective study techniques.

• Built with a lightweight tech stack (1 dependency — Express.js),
  the app is fast, portable, and easy to deploy.

• The gamification element (study streaks + confetti celebrations)
  keeps students motivated and engaged.

• The glassmorphism UI design with animations makes studying feel
  modern and enjoyable rather than tedious.

• This project demonstrates that a simple, well-designed tool
  can significantly enhance the self-study experience.
